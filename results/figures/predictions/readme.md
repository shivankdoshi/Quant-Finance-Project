# Results Directory

This directory stores the results of the analysis and modeling.

## Structure

- **`figures/`**: Contains plots and visualizations generated during data exploration, model evaluation, and performance analysis. Examples include actual vs. predicted prices, feature importance charts, and any other relevant visualizations.
  
- **`predictions/`**: Stores CSV files containing the model's predictions on the test set or any new data. These files can be used for backtesting or further analysis.

## Notes

- Keep a clear record of what each figure represents, including the date and conditions under which it was generated.
- Save predictions with timestamps or versions to track changes over time.
